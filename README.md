# frontEndTest
I buid this project in pure css and js, without bootstrap or jQuery, although that will be much easier.

For the HTML part: I divided it into 5 parts:1.nav  2.header 3.introduction 4.room-type menu  5.room description

For the CSS part: I use float and flex for layout and use media query for responsive purpose. I planed to build a grid system by myself to facilitate the layout, but don't have enough time. I added some css3 transform when I hover on the li and animation to the button to improve the user experience. 

For the JS part: I build a template to insert into the room description div according to the type of room selected by customers which is obtained by event delegation. I also count out how many friends in room and sort it by sort() method.
